        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
            This was a recipe that I used for a group meal at Burning Man. It will vacuum seal and keep for extended periods, 
            the long sealing process actually helped a lot of the flavors settle in together. 
            I added some pan seared Field Roast sausage to this for a hearty meat flavor and addition.

            <p>Terry's vegetarian Ukrainian borscht is so thick with vegetables, you can barely drag a spoon through it. 
            It's got a lovely balance of tart vinegar and natural sweetness from the beets, and a melange of textures from carefully diced carrots, 
            potatoes, onions and, the secret ingredient, a mix of frozen vegetables. It's vegan and gluten-free, but no self-respecting Ukrainian 
            would dream of eating it without a generous dollop of sour cream. In short, it's a borscht recipe that deserves to be made a part of your regular soup repertoire.</p>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add vegetable oil to a heavy-bottomed pot. Add beets and sauté until a bit softened, about 30 minutes, covering after 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Uncover, add carrots and sauté an additional 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add onions and garlic, add sauté another 10 minutes before adding the potatoes, water, and broth</li>
                <li>Cover, increase heat and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once boiling, add bay leaf and allspice peppercorns, reduce heat to medium and let everything cook together until all vegetables are soft, about 20-30 mins.</li>
                <li>Add chopped herbs.</li>
            
                <p> You can eat the borscht right then, thought its best allowed to rest overnight for the flavours to come together. Serve with sour cream and more herbs.</p>
