    <h1 id="header">Meal Prep Recipes for Burning Man and other Festivals</h1>
    <p>In this project for the foundations course on the odin project I would like to share a few meals that have been useful when meal prepping for a medium side 
        food share group at Burning Man and other festivals. These recipes have been proven to be a tasty and hearty addition to a rotation of meals within my vegan meal pod. 
        I am not 100% vegan myself, but these are low cost, healthy and keep well when vacuum sealed and stored in a cooler for at least a week. Some even develope a richer flavor from being sealed.
